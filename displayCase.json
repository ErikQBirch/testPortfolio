He shared with me a few examples of his work when we lived in the same apartment at the start of our college experiences several years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed reading them all! <br><br> Loving his writing style and stories so much, I asked and obtained permission to create a portoflio website displaying his works. Many of the stories displayed on the website are original works of his own along with a few selected works of fan-art; all of them worthy of reading. <br><br> This website was constructed using Boot Strap software. It is still in development due to lack of textual content and cover images,  but additions and improvements will be made in the future."

The turn out was a great success as I shared it with my church group during a gathered game night! Lots of people enjoyed returning to family trees, learning about their ancestors, and getting Bingos!<br><br>This site was much simpler when I first shared it; consisting only a randomizer that displayed various bingo combos and a section to show which combos were already called out. After testing out on a live audience, I found out having a timer setting would be very beneficial for the game (especially if the randomizer was linked to the timer to show combos in equal timed intervals."
