The work I strive to accomplish is unique. While keeping efficiency and effectiveness in mind, my work is my art which I want to be greater than average and above mediocracy. But, my boss and clients come first; so if it makes them happy, that's good enough for me.
My intent is to bring light into the world. Whether it be in the lives I work for or those I work with; things are better when there's creativity, color, and wondor.
