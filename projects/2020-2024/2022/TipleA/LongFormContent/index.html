    <section>
      <p>There is a lot that needs to be considered when you are a beginner free-lance worker. Content creation, social media presence, marketing, and portfolio management are only a few of the many fields that a free-lance worker has to fight on. </p>
      <p>Want a way to relieve yourself of some of that stress? Here’s a suggestion: get a website for your portfolio and make sure it is built by a professional.</p>
      <p>“Built by a professional? That costs money. Is that really necessary? I could just build one myself. And come to think of it, is having my own web portfolio even necessary? I’m doing pretty good already with [insert social media platform].” </p>
      <p>If these thoughts are floating in your head, continue reading and I will explain my reasoning. You’ll see for yourself where I’m coming from. </p>

      <h1>Professionalism: the objective of LinkedIn users </h1>
      <p>First off ask yourself, why do you post creative content on LinkedIn? You have other options such as Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. If you’re smart, you’ll be using these sites as well, but again, why are you on LinkedIn?</p>
      <p>If you know LinkedIn, you know that’s where the professionals work. Businesses, corporations, enterprises, experts; LinkedIn is their social media playground. If you’re looking for sustainable contract work and want to be noticed by a business with a name, this is the site you’ll want to be posting content. </p>
      <p>After a while of feeding the network with your content, you will eventually be found by someone. The question is though; will you be ready when you are found? Would your level of professionalism satisfy the expectations and requirements of potential employers? </p>
      <p>They will be looking at your level of Activity on LinkedIn, your attached Resume, information about your level of education, interest, and whatever you put in your bio, to determine if you’re a suitable candidate or not. Whether or not you have your own website will also influence the likelihood of employers reaching out to you.</p>

      <h1>Why have your own website</h1>
      
      <h2>A Badge of Professionalism</h2>
      <p>First off, having a website of your own is a flex in and of itself. Though there are websites out there that make building your own website easier; it still takes time, purpose, and thoughtful consideration to build an effective/meaningful website. Website building isn’t usually a past time activity people do for fun. Having your own website done right means you mean business (most times literally). </p>
      
      <h2>All about you</h2>
      <p>When you have your own website, it’s like you have your own Pinterest or Instagram. And I’m not talking about having your own Pinterest or Instagram account; I mean you have you have a web platform that’s like Pinterest or Instagram but of your very own. It’s a hundred percent you and your work on that site. You don’t have to share or compete with anyone else when a viewer is visiting your url. It’s your house, baby!</p>
      <p>You might say in response, “You could say the same thing about my [insert media platform] profile. I own the stage when people look at my profile.”</p>
      <p>True. But think about this way.</p>
      <p>Let’s say social media platforms are like a busy street bazaar. There are thousands of shops, stands, and booths up and down the place. Everyone has some sample work on outside displays where others can easily see and being updated regularly. Some people have entrances to the back of their shops visible to street viewers. These would represent portfolio websites.</p>
      <p>Let’s say someone looking to hire someone in your line of work somehow stumbles in front of your booth. Then what? One or two things might catch their eyes, but if they aren’t truly hooked, then what? They’ll simply just keep walking down the street and look for eye catchers being displayed at other stalls. The control you had is now gone.</p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, they are hooked and want to do business with you: congrats! But how are they going to contact you? Are they going to keep visiting you at the Social Media Bazaar? Wouldn’t it be better if you had some kind of office they could reach you at? If all you have is a street booth without a headquarters behind it, they’ll be out of luck.</p>
      <p>If one or two things catch their eyes and they see you have more stuff behind your street booth (your website), they’ll want to go inside and explore. Bingo! When they are inside, they see you have your office set up there too! Knowing they can reach out to you professionally rather than having to visit you at the social media bazaar every time they want to contact you is also a sign of professionalism.</p>
      
      <h2>The difference between being Found and being Known</h2>
      <p>Now don’t get me wrong, utilizing social media such as Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, etc. is actually super beneficial and should be done! There are plenty of professionals that use these platforms and sometimes that’s what they solely use as their portfolio. </p>
      <p>The main purpose of using social media platforms is to get found. Everyone uses them. Not all of them are professional employers, but you’ll still be found.</p> 
      <p>If you want to be known though, you’ll have to do more. </p>
      <p>Thus, get a website.</p>

      <h1>Why hire a professional</h1>
      <p>If you do decide to get a website in addition to your social media site, how are you going to do it? Here are some reasons why you should get professional help instead of going the D.I.Y. path.</p>
      <h2>Feed your Forte</h2>
      <p>To all your free-lance contractors, why do employers hire you? It’s because you’re an expert at what you do. You know how to do what you do, and they don’t. Your employers are experts at their trade, not yours. Same goes to you and whomever you hire to construct your website. </p>
      <p>Now, non-professionals can produce professional works, but experts have a greater chance at it. This is because the work they do is their forte, they knows the in’s, out’s, tricks, and secrets. You do not. You could spend time learning, but do you have time for that?</p>

      <h2>Priorities</h2>
      <p>Those that are considered experts have spent lots of time developing their skills to that level. If you want a professional website, do you have the time to learn everything to produce something professional? If you remember from the beginning, you already have a lot of battle fronts to fight on.</p>
      <p>So maybe you should scrape some food off your plate. Your main focus should be the content you provide. The more time you have with it, the greater quality it will be. And good quality content is a critical aspect of even having a website.</p>

      <h2>Bias</h2>
      <p>If you didn’t take the advice to hire someone and took the time to build your own, how did you do? You linked it to your LinkedIn and your shared it with others, asking for feedback, and what do you get back?</p>
      <p>Most likely, you’ll get a lot of “Looks great!” and “Good jobs!” and other words of congratulations. Get enough of these and you’ll think your site is hot stuff. But do you think employers offering contract work would see your site under a similar light? </p>
      <p>Maybe, maybe not. If you had an expert build you a website while you focused on the creating the content you excel at producing; the possibility of “maybe not” would most definitely be less than going the D.I.Y. route. </p>
      <p>And again, that’s not to say that non-experts aren’t capable of make actually good websites.</p>

      <h1>My Credibility</h1>
      <p>You’ve made it this far now, but you might have wondered at some point, “Who is this guy and who is he to tell me how to go about my online portfolio?” </p>
      <p>Well, if you haven’t noticed from the images provided, to put simply I am an artist that is not at the level of being an expert. The fact that some of this content is not of professional quality yet attached to a blog post talking about focusing on your area of expertise should show how counter intuitive the concept is.  </p>
      <p>Also like many of you, I do not have the funds to hire an expert to do artwork for me. So I somewhat know how it feels to having to make do with what I can rather than getting assistance from those of a higher caliber. If I did have the means, I would hire an expert to do artwork I’d want done to accompany that which I excel in. All I can do now though is save up my pennies for such pleasures. </p>
      <p>Thus, I can encourage this in others as well.  </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>So there you have it; a complete explanation about why you as a free-lance creator should invest in getting your own website and why you should have a professional do it for you. The main goal is to acquire professionalism which comes from standing above the crowd and high quality content. </p>
      <p>Should you continue to utilize popular social media platforms? Yes. Should you do the best you can while you save up money and means to get professional assistance? Of Course! But if you want to be known, don’t be content with doing what everyone else does or living with the bare minimum. Get a website.</p>
      <p>Also, comment on this and share your thoughts. And if you have a website and want critique on how to improve it, reach out to me!</p>
