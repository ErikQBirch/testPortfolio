I didn’t draw a background for this one because they could be walking anywhere: on a beach, in a field of wheat, or wherever. We all have different roads in life. Another thing I really like about this is that from the girl’s positon and body language; she is really happy. It’s pretty outside, they are having a good time, it’s peaceful; it’s a good day!",

All the girls surrounding him are the same person and the main character of the story. Each one is a representation of the girl at different stages as she grew up under Blake’s care.<br>Another interpretation of the illustration would be that all the girls are separate individuals and the oldest girl with the sword helps Blake take care of the others as they grow up.",

The girl and boy might be together or this might be a first encounter as they head in the same direction with similar intentions. So many possibilities!

The feeling that inspired this drawing stems from a time when I had a disagreement with another person and not getting along with them. It’s not a peaceful picture. The situation at the time wasn’t too heated, but it definitely wasn’t peaceful.

What I really love about it is that in its physical form, this painting is actually pretty small. I painted it in a notebook and it was about four inches by three or three and a half inches.  I like painting small things over big things.<br>The dragon itself is one I frequently draw and paint. One of the characters in my story has a pet dragon of this shape. One of my characters can shape shift into a dragon like this. If I draw a dragon, it will most likely be this dragon.",
